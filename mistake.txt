Some mistake in coding :
Hardcoding: Putting fixed values (like passwords or URLs) directly in the code.
Poor Naming: Using vague variable names like x, temp, or data.
Violating DRY: (Don't Repeat Yourself) Copy-pasting the same code multiple times.
Ignoring Errors: Not using try-catch blocks to handle potential crashes.
God Functions: Writing single functions that are too long and do too many things.
Global Variables: Overusing global scope, which makes debugging difficult.
No Comments: Writing complex logic without explaining "why" it exists.
Spaghetti Code: Writing messy, unstructured code that is hard to follow.
Premature Optimization: Trying to make code faster before it even works correctly.
Not Using Git: Failing to use version control to track changes.
