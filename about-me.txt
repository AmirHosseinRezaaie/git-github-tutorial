Hello!
I'm Amirhossein Rezaaie with 403541474 student number 
My favorite programming language is Python.
I decided to learn Git because it’s the version control system and an essential skill for any serious developer.
 It allows me to:

Track every change in my code safely
Collaborate efficiently with teams without overwriting each other’s work
Roll back mistakes instantly
Experiment with new features on separate branches without breaking the main code
Contribute to open-source projects and work in professional environments where Git (and usually GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) is used daily

In short, knowing Git deeply has made me a much more confident, productive, and employable developer.
